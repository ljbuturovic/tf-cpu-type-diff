Demonstrate different results with Tensorflow on Intel and AMD CPUs

This program demonstrates that running identical machine learning processing on Intel and AMD CPUs yields slightly different results. 

The processing consists of training an MLP classifier using a training set of tabular data and applying it to a validation set.
The code trains the model and computes predicted probabilities when the model is applied to the validation set.
